# Ford GoBike Data Exploration 


## Dataset

This report presents data exploration of the Ford GoBike System data, Which includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during the month of February. In particular, the data contained the following features: Duration In Secounds, Start Station ID, Start Station Name, Start Station Latitude, Start Station Longitude, End Station ID, End Station Name, End Station Latitude, End Station Longitude, Bike ID, User Type (Subscriber or Customer), Member Year of Birth and Member Gender.

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data using Python data visualization libraries. To explore the data, I will performe three types of visualizations: univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualizations.

In the second part, I will take the main findings from the exploratory analysis and create an explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.


## Summary of Findings


The following are the main findings from the exploratory analysis using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualization for the Ford Gobike dataset.

Throughout exploration of the GoBike system data, I have discovered that there are more male users in Ford GoBike than females. Furthermore, the majority of users who participate in the Ford GoBike trips were subscribers not customers.

When analyzing the day of weeks, the findings showed that there is higher frequency of bike trips on weekdays than on weekends, and most of the trips started on Tuesday and Thursday.And when analyzing the time of bike trips, GoBike users are most frequent during the peak hours. 

The findings also showed that participants who were Customers took longer time to complete the trip than subscribers. Based on gender, males appeared to complete the trip faster than females. I also found that most of GoBikes users did't use bike share for all of their trips.
 


## Key Insights for Presentation

This presentation will focus on how user type and gender impact the duration of usage of Ford Gobikes. Which will be converted into minutes.

- Customers took longer time to complete the trip than subscribers. 

- When analyzing the day of weeks, subscribers tends to use the service in weekdays.

- Regardless of the user type, males appear to complete the trip faster than females.
